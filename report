Netflix Movies and TV Shows Dataset

1. Introduction
The repository contains a data analysis project focused on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a Netflix dataset. 
The main objective is to extract insights about Netflix content trends, patterns, and distributions using Python libraries and visualizations.

2. Dataset Description

Dataset Name: Netflix Movies and TV Shows

Source: Kaggle

File Used: netflix_titles.csv

Data Type: Structured, mixed (categorical + numerical)

The dataset contains information about content available on Netflix, including both movies and TV shows.

3. Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Pandas for data manipulation

Matplotlib for basic visualizations

Seaborn for statistical plots

4. Data Overview

Initial inspection of the dataset revealed:

Presence of both numerical and categorical features

Missing values in columns such as director, cast, and country

Clean and well-structured data suitable for exploratory analysis

Descriptive statistics were used to understand data ranges, central tendencies, and distributions.

5. Exploratory Data Analysis

5.1 Distribution of Numerical Features

A histogram of the release_year column showed that:

Most Netflix content was released after 2010

There is a sharp increase in content production in recent years

Insight:

Netflix focuses heavily on modern and recent productions.

5.2 Categorical Feature Analysis

Movies vs TV Shows

A count plot comparing content types revealed:

Movies significantly outnumber TV shows on Netflix

Insight:

The platform’s catalog is movie-dominated.

Content Rating Distribution

Ratings such as TV-MA and TV-14 are most frequent

Insight:

Netflix targets mature and teenage audiences more than children.

5.3 Outlier Detection

Release Year

Box plot analysis showed:

Most content lies between 2010–2021

Older titles (before 1990) appear as outliers

Insight:

Older movies are rare and treated as exceptions.

5.4 Duration Analysis

The duration column was processed by extracting numerical values:

Movies → duration in minutes

TV Shows → number of seasons

When analyzed together, the box plot showed wide variation due to mixed units.

After separating content types:

Movies: Mostly between 80–120 minutes

TV Shows: Mostly 1–3 seasons

Insight:

Movie duration is fairly consistent, while TV shows vary by season count.

5.5 Correlation Analysis

A correlation heatmap of numerical features showed:

Weak correlation between release_year and duration

Features are largely independent

Insight:

Most features contribute unique information and are suitable for modeling.

6. Important Features Identified

Based on EDA, the following features are important for prediction or recommendation tasks:

type

release_year

rating

duration

listed_in

country

7. Summary of Findings

Netflix content is dominated by movies.

Majority of titles were released after 2010.

TV-MA and TV-14 are the most common ratings.

Movie durations typically range between 80–120 minutes.

TV shows usually have 1–3 seasons.

Older content appears as outliers in release year analysis.

8. Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a real-world entertainment dataset. It effectively uses Python and visualization tools to:

identify patterns,

understand key distributions, and

highlight interesting trends in Netflix content.
